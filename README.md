# Projet sur PySpark

STIB is a company providing public transport in Brussels.

My team was challenged to analyse data and provide the following insights:
1. Analyze the vehicle speed over the different network segments, how it varies across segments and over time. 
2. Analyze the vehicle delays at the different stops, how it varies across stops, and over time.
3. Given a vehicle start time, do arrival time forecasting at a given stop in the route of this vehicle. 
4. The GPS tracks are for real people moving in Brussels. In fact they are from the teachers. You are asked to infer the mode of transport of each of these tracks (bus, tram, etc)
5. Think your own of a valuable analysis on this data (we did a web application with Streamlit)

The teachers have collected about 3 weeks of this data for us:
* The location of all vehicles every +-30 seconds, encoded in JSON.
* Shape files describing the map (lines and stops) of STIB network, two snapshots 3 September and 23 September
* GTFS files containing the offline plan/schedule covering the same period of the vehicle location data, two snapshots 3 September and 23 September
* In addition you get a number of GPS tracks for task number 2
